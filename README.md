# Humanitarian Response Tracking System

The onset of major disaster or crisis in a country immediately triggers a collaborative & coordinated humanitarian response from international communities. The recent example being the April 2015 Nepal earthquake response by, among myriad of agencies, Save The Children, Dan Church Aid, DFID, GIZ, IOM etcetera, which was coordinated by the UN OCHA. 

As part of the early response, efforts of rescue, relief & aid distributions, and infrastructure support are paramount priority for the agencies to save the victims’ lives & support them with relief & resilience. 

I propose to develop the ‘Humanitarian Response Tracking System’ for such agencies engaging in rapid humanitarian intervention. The system will support the agency to track their activities, including the beneficiary information, aid distribution counts, based on locations & technical clusters (WASH, Logistics, Food, Shelter etc.). This will also help them with monitoring & evaluation as well as help them to review their logical framework for target/results analysis.

The need for the system was felt by me personal experience, during my visit & research to one of the leading humanitarian organizations responding to the Nepal Earthquake. There was no in-house robust system to track their response. Instead, they relied on 3W/4W analysis of OCHA’s cluster reports, which all agencies were required to fill.  All the data were locked into massive spreadsheets.  & any kind of analysis was extremely difficult & time consuming. All this will be taken into account by my system. 

I have planned to base my system entirely on Microsoft Access 2016, part of the office suite. It is a DBMS that combines Jet Database engine with a GUI & software development tools. Both the front end & back end can be developed using Access. And it stores all the queries, tables, forms, controls, macros, & the data in a single database file. It is also supported by VBA, an event driven programming language to define the behaviors & properties of controls & objects as per changing user inputs. (Products.office.com, 2016)
